# Simple-GOG-Scraper

A simple project that collects the titles and prices of games on the front page of gog.com, one of the largest (and my favourite) digital video game stores.
You can change which pages you want to collect information from by changing the values of **"pages-start"** and **"pages-end"**. You can also add additional parameters 
by adding the necessary values to the "parameters" dictionary (for example: **{"page": i, "genres": "action}**).
